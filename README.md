The archive is not filled yet with anything. I'm very busy, but want to make this project work... so be a little patience with me.

Soon here will be following objects:
- Buttons : Edit buttons, Text buttons, Keyboard buttons, Bottom buttons, Image buttons
- Images : With backgrounds, rounded rectangles, adjustable gravity, labels
- Sliders
- Swype dialog going up/down or left/right
- 2D swype dialog (matrix)
- Drag and drop, also from swype list
- Dialog solution
- Messagebox solution
- Edit text
- Chinese input method (no, I am not a Chinese)
